Why? You&#39;ve seen many haunted houses in your 10 year lifespan so you don&#39;t feel scared at all. However, this one is going to be much scarier than your worst nightmares. Because you&#39;ll never leave........
But for right now you don&#39;t know that, so you go ahead anyway.

It&#39;s Halloween, your favorite time of year!
However, little do you know, you&#39;re going to remember this day with horror, and not the haunted house kind of horror. Much, much worse.

Anyway, you dress up in your special handmade costume and grab a candy basket. Now you&#39;re ready!

You visit houses you&#39;ve planned out on a map. You visit houses with the most candy. You even ate some. On your way back an old lady on her front porch calls to you and says&quot;Do you want some more candy young child??&#39;&#39;.  Of course, greedy, gullible you takes her up on this offer and she lets you inside. But before you know it, you wake up in an old cellar filled with other children gagged and tied up. You desperately try to wiggle free and eventually, it works! As you wiggle free you hear a scream from another room now you&#39;re very frightened. Should you free the other kids??

Should you use the barred window thats out of your reach or the 
wooden, creaky old door??
